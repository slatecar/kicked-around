Kicked Around
By Carmine Slate


Description:
This project outlines how to build the book into various ebook formats.
For a direct link to download the book, visit: https://kicked-around.blogspot.com


Setup:
1.) Download kindlegen: https://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html?docId=1000765211
2.) Decompress and untar to /kindlegen/ directory
3.) Install the necessary Ubuntu packages: apt-get install make pandoc espeak mbrola ffmpeg calibre


Instructions for use:
1.) Create the book in the Word processor of choice.  Export to docx format.
2.) Convert to markup: pandoc --from=docx --to=markdown --output=file.md file.docx
3.) Copy markup to individual [chapter].md files. Markup will be cleaned up during build process
4.) Build the book: make clean; make book
5.) Book files located in /build/
NOTE: If you do a "make all", this will build the audiobook which will take much time


Instructions for updating:
1.) Update each chapter one at a time using the editor of your choice
2.) Re-Build the book: make clean; make book
3.) Book files located in /build/
NOTE: If you do a "make all", this will build the audiobook which will take much time


Tips and Advice:
1.) Write your ideas in whatever manner you feel the most comfortable
2.) Pull them together in a combined document using the word processor of your choice
 - Google Docs are good because they are accessbile from anywhere that your Google Account is accessible and they keep revision history for all updates
 - Divide up your docs by chapter, because the larger the document is, the longer it takes to load up when you open it on a new device
3.) Use a Grammar tool other than the one included with a traditional word processor
 - Grammarly is good for this.  It catches things that LibreOffice and Google Docs does not
4.) There are plenty of 100% free royalty-free image sites on the internet to download images for your cover
 - If you don't know how to use a tool like Gimp for image editing, consider using a service like Fiverr to find an artist to make your cover
5.) Re-read, revise, re-read, revise, revise again, revise yet again, re-read, revise...
 - Your first draft is going to be bad.  Accept it and keep working.  Keep revising it until it feels great.  Then, re-read it and revise it again.
 - Tell yourself that after X number of revisions, you will publish.  Make X large (like 10 or 15, but realize it could be 20 or more before you stop rewriting scenes or dialog).
 - No matter how many times you revise, if you re-read the book after you publish you will probably wish you would have changed something.  Hindsight is always 20/20.
6.) Let someone else give you feedback
 - A friend or family member is good, but try to find someone that is unbiased.
 - Reddit and various other sites have sections where you can post portions of your book.  People will read it and respond with honest feedback.
7.) Let the process flow naturally
 - It's normal to want to be "done", but don't rush it.  When the book "feels like it's done", then it's done.  Before that, it's not, so don't push it out.
 - It may take 15-20 full revisions before you feel like it's done.  Keep at it, don't give up.
8.) Slow down when revising
 - You may have re-read your book 20 times, but when revising, try to pretend it's the first time, for each revision.  Concentrate on anything that pulls in "prior knowledge of the text."
 - You may find out by re-reading that you referenced a character by name and he should be unknown, because you don't introduce him for 2 more chapters.  That can be confusing to the reader.
 - You may find that when your near the end of a revision that you start skimming through the chapters.  Don't.  Treat each chapter individually and give it the time it deserves.
 - You may find that you've provided "too much context" to something that needs no explanation.  Cut out the fluff.  It may feel like a "waste of words and time", but it's part of the process.

Acknowledgment

<br />

Thank you for reading!

I hope you found the story entertaining and worth your time. I had a fun
time building out the story and the characters. I hope you had just as
much fun reading it.

If you are willing to, I would appreciate it if you could review and
rate the book wherever you found it. At the very least, it'll help me
understand if there are people out there that would like to read more
about these characters.
